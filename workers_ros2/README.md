TODO: combine this with the top level README

This is the ros2 adapter for workers, based on:
- Project Description: Proximity Based Speed Control with Emergency Stop;
- the response document: high-level design sketch, in the top level README.

MISSING FILES:
- likely use AI tools to generate boiler plate ROS2 setup.py, package.xml
- create pyproject.toml with care (leave python dependencies as an empty list, to fill in as needed)
- IDL interface declaration is needed.
